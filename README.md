Hi, I'm Leruo Setlhalogile (a.k.a. YourBoiRuo) ðŸ‘‹
Welcome to my GitHub profile! ðŸŒŸ Iâ€™m a 15-year-old South African coder whoâ€™s passionate about web development and constantly learning new skills. I specialize in HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript, and Iâ€™m currently diving into PHP, Python, and game development with Unity.

Iâ€™m here to showcase my work and prove that age doesnâ€™t define skill or potential. My journey has been full of challenges, but each setback is a setup for a comeback. ðŸ“ˆ

"Every failure is just a step towards success. Keep pushing, no matter where you start. Your hustle and grit matter more than your background."
